## üìù Summary

l revel in solving critical problems, developing algorithms, and building cutting-edge mobile applications. I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy working with others towards success as a team. I seek to surround myself with motivated, like-minded engineers who inspire me. I currently develop mobile apps at Cimbuk Labs where I have experience working in the design and development of both greenfield and brownfield mobile applications across various platforms using hybrid and native technologies. I previously worked on building cross-platform app at Extreme Solutions where I shipped features and released a new version of the app on app stores, worked on building the core app at Cynergy Solutions, as a programmer I built and launched web app at Automate Infosys. I hold top 5% in Associate's degree in Computer Engineering from Chittagong Polytechnic Institute, 2013-2018. During my time in school, I was a researcher and engineer who built and launched a education management system web app at Automate Infosys which received an award from the school at the annual showcase. Currently I am studying BSc in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Creative Technology, Chittagong, Bangladesh (Expected to graduate in December 2022). Moreover, I founded and led tutoring services at the computer programming for 3 years.

I am interested in all things related to technology and designs, and my most recent career interests lie in Full Stack Development, Mobile Application Development, Human-Computer Interaction, Internet Application Design & Development, and Software Architecture.
